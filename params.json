In Australia, we’ve held two events, the first in Sydney (November 2015) and then in Melbourne (April 2016). Many of the solutions developed are now operating as tech start-ups in their own right.\r\nOur next Hackathon will focus specifically on hacking the challenges faced by young people (~16 to 24). Of course if you’re older than that we’re still keen for you to participate!\r\nOnce again, we will bring together developers, designers, entrepreneurs and community members to develop creative tech solutions. It doesn’t matter if you’ve never been to a Hackathon everyone is welcome and you’ll have tons of fun while learning new skills and meeting lots of great people.\r\nHacker Teams will develop tech solutions for young refugee settlement challenges articulated by our partners including Settlement Services International (SSI) the largest not-for-profit humanitarian settlement organisation in Australia.\r\nThemes for the Hack will include: *safety and well-being * learning the language * community connections * recognition for prior qualifications * employment * identity and belonging * knowledge of support services. These are very serious and important topics and to ensure we have lots of fun, we will also award a prize for the Hack that makes Sydney more Awesome for Young Refugees, thanks to support from the Awesome Foundation Sydney.\r\nRefugees especially young refugees who have already settled in Australia will participate in the event to help teams deeply understand problems and challenges faced by new arrivals. Those who participated in our first events know that hearing from and working alongside refugees was an absolute highlight of our previous Hackathons.\r\nLeaders from the Tech Community will mentor teams through the weekend. On Sunday afternoon, teams will pitch their solutions to a Judging Panel of Tech and Community Leaders.\r\nThe event is supported by City of Parramatta Council and will be in Parramatta, Western Sydney because this is where most refugees settle. There is no cost to participate and wonderful food and snacks will be available all weekend.\r\nWe are planning to award sensational prizes that help teams complete and launch their solutions including a place at Catalysr, a refugee and migrant incubator, a cash prize from the Awesome Foundation Sydney and a whole bunch of awesome stuff from Academy Xi who provide tech courses for UX, UI, Virtual Reality and more. Stay tuned for more info on prizes! \r\nCome make a difference, have some fun, learn a lot and help to welcome young refugees to the Australian community.  \r\nPRIZES, SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS - Please contact us if you'd like to contribute a prize or sponsor the Hack!\r\n##Prizes\r\nFirst Prize: $15,000 cash prize to fully develop the solution  jointly sponsored by Settlement  Services International (SSI), Stripe and the City of Parramatta.
